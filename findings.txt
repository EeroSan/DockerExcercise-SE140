In my project the services primarily share the network with the host. 
Some access to filesystem is also shared and the services can see 
how big the hard drive filesystem is even though it is not mounted. 
Disk utilization and partition is also exposed.
Processes running on the host machine are not exposed to the container.
Uptime does not reveal how long the host has been online.
